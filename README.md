# Model_Rocket_Simulation
Welcome to the 49er Rocketry Club's repository for simulating model rockets. This code is currently under development 
and might not be complete. The end goal is to produce a simulation model with 6 degrees of freedom where several 
vehicle controllers can be developed.
# _The code is currently under development and not really meant for public consumption._  
If you have stumbled upon this repository because you are interested in model rockets and are looking for 
software to simulate said vehicles, you may be interested in looking at the code but you will probably not be able to run it.
But check back for updates. When the code is ready for a first release we will update this readme with instructions for installing
and running.
